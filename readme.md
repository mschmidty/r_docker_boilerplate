# A Docker Compose File to Setup and Run R Scripts
This project is a R Docker boilerplate that uses Docker Compose.  It uses the `{renv}` package for dependency management. To get this working, clone the repo and from within the project root run `docker-compose up`.  The R file should run and the container will stop when the file is finished.
